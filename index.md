### **My name is Defne Dilbaz.**
  
I am a 25 year old Software Engineer at Intel Corporation. I graduated from the University of Toronto Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022 with minors in Engineering Business, and Robotics and Mechatronics; and a certificate in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. 

During my undergrad, I focused on computer hardware and control streams. During second year, I built a [pattern memory game:](https://github.com/defnedilbaz/Feel-The-Grid){:target="_blank"} in Verilog with my Digital Systems course partner, [Sarhad Salam](https://github.com/SarhadSalam){:target="_blank"}. For ECE297, Design and Communication course, I developed [SquadMaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NwSkulI8CA){:target="_blank"} - a geographical information system (like Google Maps) in C++ - with [Sarhad Salam](https://github.com/SarhadSalam){:target="_blank"} and [Zeng Zeng](https://github.com/XiuLuoShen){:target="_blank"}. In third year, I took part in [Bridgestone World Solar Challenge 2019](https://www.worldsolarchallenge.org){:target="_blank"} as an electrical-electromechanical team member for [Blue Sky Solar Racing](http://blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/?page_id=368){:target="_blank"}s. During Summer 2020, I took APS360 and designed an AI Project classifies ingreient photos and recommends recipes based on ingredients and dietary restrictions. 

Besides engineering, I am a creative writer since I was 6. You can find some of my works on [Medium](https://medium.com/@defne.dilbaz) I am also passionate about sketching, dancing, and music. 

I am passionate about software, embedded systems and robotics. 

Feel free to get in touch with me if you are interested in my work.
