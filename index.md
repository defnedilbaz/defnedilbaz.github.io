### **My name is Defne Dilbaz.**
  
I am a third year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto with minors in Engineering Business and Robotics. 

I am in the computer hardware and control streams. During second year, I built a [pattern memory game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5tm9gaLZFA) in Verilog with my Digital Systems course partner, [Sarhad Salam](https://github.com/SarhadSalam). For ECE297, Design and Communication course, I developed [SquadMaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NwSkulI8CA) - a geographical information system (like Google Maps) in C++ - with [Sarhad Salam](https://github.com/SarhadSalam) and [Zeng Zeng](https://github.com/XiuLuoShen). In third year, I took part in [Bridgestone World Solar Challenge 2019](https://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/) as an electrical-electromechanical team member for [Blue Sky Solar Racing](http://blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/?page_id=3687). I am passionate about [quantum computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUWtEOjGNU0) and currently, I am working with Dr. Thi Ha Kyaw on 0-&#960; qubit structure improvements. 

Besides engineering, I am a creative writer since I was 6. I am also passionate about sketching, dancing, and music. 

Studying at a world-renowned university with students from various backgrounds and exceptional skills was my dream. Now, I get to live my dream on a daily basis, and I am forever grateful for all the opportunities I have in life. My long-term goal is to explore my field in-depth, take part in projects that will create a positive and lasting impact on our world, and have fun all the while doing it. 

Feel free to get in touch with me if you are interested in my work.
